# Let's cook

Letâ€™s cook is a website featuring recipes added by the community. It could be a source of inspiration for your next meal or a place to share your creation. The main goal of the project is to enable the user to interact with a database, preforming basic data manipulation operations.

This is the third project in Code Institute Full Stack Developer program based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, MongoDB and other optional frameworks and libraries.
